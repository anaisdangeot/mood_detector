Girl you know we belong together
I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby
You just wait

We belong together
And you know that I am right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?

Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never
Say goodbye?

When I can't sleep at night
Without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head
Oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinning around and around

Although we've come
